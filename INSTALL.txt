This is a util to pull JSON data from the opensimworld.com
website and create a static HTML file with the stats for
the desired regions.

Required Perl extensions:
=========================
File::Copy
HTTP::Tiny
Data::Dumper
LWP::Simple
JSON
String::Scanf

Its intended to be used with a iframe, which will be described
below.

You should run this from a cron job every 5 minutes using a
line such as this:
--
*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/perl /root/scrapeosworld/scrapeworld.pl
    Replace "/root/scrapeosworld" with wherever you wish to
run it from.
--

1) Edit the sample-iframe file to point to where you have it
going, by default "/regionstats"

2) Copy the sample-iframe file into a module on your website,
or directly add the link in your index.html. If you are using
index.php, you will have to do it yourself.
